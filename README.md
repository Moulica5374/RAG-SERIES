# RAG-SERIES
RAG Retrival Augumented Generation 

RAG-SERIES (Retrieval-Augmented Generation Series) is a project that explores the power of combining information retrieval techniques with generative AI models to build intelligent, context-aware systems.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by supplementing them with relevant external knowledge from documents, databases, or APIs at runtime. This makes the model:

More factual and grounded

Capable of answering domain-specific questions

Up-to-date without needing retraining

This series walks through multiple stages of building RAG pipelines—from basic PDF Q&A systems to advanced multi-agent architectures—with integration of tools like LangChain, Chroma, and various embedding models.


The below is very good overview architecture from the coursera
